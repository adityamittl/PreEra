# PRE ERA

## 💡 Inspiration

When the Pandemic began, all the public places were shut including Museums. Since people could no longer visit museums, we brought the museum to people's homes. This will not only bring joy to all the Dinosaur Lovers out there but Private Tour feature, build some extra income for all the museum staff and Paleontologists out there.

## 💻 What it does

Thalassophile exhibits various species of Dinosaurs and Old age Tools (the ones that are found at the museum), elucidates their features, and imitates them into the real world using AR (Augmented Reality) technology. <br>
Moreover, it provides a Private Tour functionality where people can book a private tour by an expert from the museum at the comfort of their homes.

## ⚙️ How it works

- Users need to Log In/Sign Up
- Users can explore various models of Old age tools and ancient animals (like Dinosaurs)
- After selecting a model, users can interact with the 3D model by changing its orientation or zooming in or out.
- (maybe if present) Users can explore more about the animal/tool by clicking on it, such as if you click on the fin of the shark it will give a short description about that
- Users can also view all the animals/tools in AR (Augmented Reality)
- Users can also book a personal tour by an expert from the museum at the comfort of their homes

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

One challenging part was how to implement the AR and rendering the 3D models using react-three-fiber, and it took a while to learn and figure out how to make it work properly in the website. 

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are happy that we completed the project in this short frame of time and we learned a lot from this hackathon

## 📖 What we learned

How to use Three Js and collaboration.

## 🚀 What's next for Pre Era

- Adding more languages
- Add more 3D models
